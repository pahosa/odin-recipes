Create a website of recipes 

Build a website to display proficiency in creating a simple website.

Website will not include CSS. It will have a recipe on how to create vegetarian pot pie.

Once website is developed, I will have shown skills of creating a functional and informational website with HTML and working with GIT, command line and VS Code.
